Overiew:
This project is a simple python cimmend-line tool that detects the hash type (MD5,SHA1,SHA256.SHA384,SHA512) and generates an MD5 hash from plaintext input.

Step:
1.The program was written and tested on kali Linux.
2.The code uses the hashlib library to generate MD5 hashes.
3.It identifies the hash type by checking its  length and hexadecimal format.
4.Screenshots were taken to show each function (MD5,SHA256,Error,Exit).
